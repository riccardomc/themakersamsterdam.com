  <meta property="og:description" content="Multitude is the multidisciplinary design studio of designers Rozemarijn Koopmans (1988, Utrecht), Nick Topp (1988, Arnhem) and David de Zwart (1989, Zutphen). Having met during their studies at&nbsp;ArtEZ Institute of the Arts&nbsp;in Arnhem, working together after university seemed like the only way to go. Since then, they have been working on a variety of different projects from the design of Milan's Tuttobene&nbsp;exhibition to&nbsp;the in-store communication of the biological supermarket&nbsp;Marqt&nbsp;to the visual identity, website and packaging of dried-fruit brand Artisani.&nbsp;I visited their studio in de Pijp, where they work with several independent industrial designers in a minimalistic and almost serene space, driven by passion and professionalism. Can you tell us a little about yourselves? We all grew up in Gelderland, an area not exactly known for its widespread creativity (although Arnhem does it’s best). I guess we shared a similar creative drives as we all entered the Graphic Design department at ArtEZ Institute of the Arts. We weren’t in the same class until the third year, when we chose the same minor-program and developed a shared interest for editorial design and research. We applied for a university-based master program in Amsterdam because we&nbsp;all felt the need to increase our skills in these areas, and during our studies, focused on design critique and writing. We then started to work on projects together and it only seemed logical to continue doing so after university, which led to starting Multitude. What brought you all to Amsterdam? David and Nick had moved to Amsterdam in the last year of their studies and Rozemarijn moved right after the year finished. We all would have moved to Amsterdam regardless of our master’s programs (Arnhem gets quite boring once school is over but the two kind of collided. Amsterdam is a great place to live - it’s not a metropolis but still large enough to feel anonymous at times. There are great museums and galleries and we really enjoy being part of the creative scene. What inspired you to start Multitude? What have your experiences been so far? Nobody really proposed the initiative to start an office. The idea to continue working together seemed like the only logical thing to do. We developed a set of skills during our studies that still complements the work we do now, with and for people that we admire. This has given us the opportunity to work with a wide variety of clients, for whom we created both visual and theoretical projects. We are responsible for the Tuttobene exhibition in Milan, which showcases Dutch design talent during&nbsp;Salone del Mobile, but we also work for the biological supermarket Marqt. We are also working on a research project that investigates the position of the court of law in the 21st century, and Rozemarijn teaches a course in Arnhem called Network Cultures. It’s great to be able to work on so many different levels. Would you say that the city of Amsterdam inspires you? We are very fond of Amsterdam, but we would move to New York in a heartbeat if the opportunity came along! But Amsterdam has a very nice atmosphere, with great initiatives in design, shops, music and food. We work in a beautiful part of the city (de Pijp) and the Albert Cuyp market is right around the corner. Anything you might need is within reach, from print shops to the Stedelijk Museum. Amsterdam can be a bit dreamy at times, which makes it quite sympathetic. What do your typical days look like?&nbsp; Usually, we are at the office together working on our projects. We plan our days together, divide our to-do’s, schedule meetings, and take care of whatever comes our way. We have to be quite flexible as there are always emergency projects that pop up when you least expect it, and we have to travel to clients all over the Netherlands. You could hardly call it just a full-time job, we are always&nbsp;working&nbsp;to some extent, even on Friday nights over a couple of beers. Can you name a few of your favorite places in Amsterdam? Well Café Brecht&nbsp;(Weteringschans 157) is definitely a favorite hangout, their beer collection is great. We are often around the area of the Zeedijk since we all love Asian food, we can recommend Thai Bird (Zeedijk 74). We are also fans of Wilde Zwijnen, Vinnies Deli, De Trut (support your local gayscene everyone!), De Twee Zwaantjes, Roest, the Noordermarkt (don't miss the bread stands!), and the bookstores&nbsp;Athenaeum&nbsp;and Mendo. What's next for Multitude? We’re looking forward to 2014! If all goes as planned, we will start working with interns soon. We hope to work on more international projects, and find some more time to do self-initiated projects that deserve more attention.&nbsp; Thank you David, Nick and Rozemarijn for this interview!

        Multitude is the multidisciplinary design studio of designers Rozemarijn Koopmans (1988, Utrecht), Nick Topp (1988, Arnhem) and David de Zwart (1989, Zutphen). Having met during their
            studies at&nbsp;
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.artez.nl/english">
         ArtEZ Institute of the Arts
        </a>
        &nbsp;in Arnhem, working together after university seemed like the only way to go.
            Since then, they have been working on a variety of different projects from the design of Milan's
        <a target="_blank" href="http://tuttobene2014.nl/">
         Tuttobene

        </a>
        .&nbsp;I visited their studio in de Pijp, where they work with several independent industrial designers in
            a minimalistic and almost serene space, driven by passion and professionalism.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         Can you tell us a little about yourselves?
        </strong>
        <br />
        We all grew up in Gelderland, an area not exactly known for its widespread creativity (although Arnhem does it’s best). I guess we shared a similar creative drives as we all entered the
            Graphic Design department at
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.artez.nl/english">
         ArtEZ Institute of the Arts
        </a>
        . We weren’t in the same class until the third year, when we chose the
            same minor-program and developed a shared interest for editorial design and research. We applied for a university-based master program in Amsterdam because we&nbsp;all felt the need to
            increase our skills in these areas, and during our studies, focused on design critique and writing. We then started to work on projects together and it only seemed logical to continue
            doing so after university, which led to starting Multitude.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         What brought you all to Amsterdam?
        </strong>

        David and Nick had moved to Amsterdam in the last year of their studies and Rozemarijn moved right after the year finished. We all would have moved to Amsterdam regardless of our master’s
            programs (Arnhem gets quite boring once school is over but the two kind of collided. Amsterdam is a great place to live - it’s not a metropolis but still large enough to feel anonymous at
            times. There are great museums and galleries and we really enjoy being part of the creative scene.

         What inspired you to start Multitude? What have your experiences been so far?
        </strong>
        <br />
        Nobody really proposed the initiative to start an office. The idea to continue working together seemed like the only logical thing to do. We developed a set of skills during our studies
            that still complements the work we do now, with and for people that we admire. This has given us the opportunity to work with a wide variety of clients, for whom we created both visual
            and theoretical projects. We are responsible for the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://tuttobene2014.nl/">
         Tuttobene

        exhibition in Milan, which showcases Dutch design talent

        , but we also work for the biological supermarket
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marqt.com/">
         Marqt
        </a>
        . We are also working on a research project that investigates the position of the court of law in the 21st century, and Rozemarijn teaches a course in
            Arnhem called Network Cultures. It’s great to be able to work on so many different levels.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         Would you say that the city of Amsterdam inspires you?
        </strong>
        <br />
        We are very fond of Amsterdam, but we would move to New York in a heartbeat if the opportunity came along! But Amsterdam has a very nice atmosphere, with great initiatives in design,
            shops, music and food. We work in a beautiful part of the city (de Pijp) and the Albert Cuyp market is right around the corner. Anything you might need is within reach, from print shops
            to the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stedelijk.nl/">
         Stedelijk Museum
        </a>
        . Amsterdam can be a bit dreamy at times, which makes it quite sympathetic.
        <br />

        <strong>
         What do your typical days look like?&nbsp;
        </strong>
        <br />
        Usually, we are at the office together working on our projects. We plan our days together, divide our to-do’s, schedule meetings, and take care of whatever comes our way. We have to be
            quite flexible as there are always emergency projects that pop up when you least expect it, and we have to travel to clients all over the Netherlands. You could hardly call it just a
            full-time job, we are
        <em>

        <p>
         Multitude is the multidisciplinary design studio of designers Rozemarijn Koopmans (1988, Utrecht), Nick Topp (1988, Arnhem) and David de Zwart (1989, Zutphen). Having met during
              their studies at&nbsp;
         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.artez.nl/english">
          ArtEZ Institute of the Arts
         </a>
         &nbsp;in Arnhem, working together after university seemed like the only way to
              go. Since then, they have been working on a variety of different projects from the design of Milan's
         <a target="_blank" href="http://tuttobene2014.nl/">
          Tuttobene

         &nbsp;exhibition
              to&nbsp;the in-store communication of the biological supermarket&nbsp;
         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marqt.com/">
          Marqt
         </a>
         &nbsp;to the visual identity, website and packaging of
              dried-fruit brand
         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.artisani.com/">
          Artisani
         </a>
         .&nbsp;I visited their studio in de Pijp, where they work with several independent industrial designers
              in a minimalistic and almost serene space, driven by passion and professionalism.
         <br />
         <br />
         <strong>
          Can you tell us a little about yourselves?
         </strong>
         <br />
         We all grew up in Gelderland, an area not exactly known for its widespread creativity (although Arnhem does it’s best). I guess we shared a similar creative drives as we all entered the
              Graphic Design department at
         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.artez.nl/english">
          ArtEZ Institute of the Arts
         </a>
         . We weren’t in the same class until the third year, when we chose the
              same minor-program and developed a shared interest for editorial design and research. We applied for a university-based master program in Amsterdam because we&nbsp;all felt the need to
              increase our skills in these areas, and during our studies, focused on design critique and writing. We then started to work on projects together and it only seemed logical to continue
              doing so after university, which led to starting Multitude.
         <br />
         <br />
         <strong>
          What brought you all to Amsterdam?
         </strong>
         <br />
         David and Nick had moved to Amsterdam in the last year of their studies and Rozemarijn moved right after the year finished. We all would have moved to Amsterdam regardless of our
