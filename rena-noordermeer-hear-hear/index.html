  <meta content='Rena Noordermeer (1984) is the founder of Hear Hear, a "tiny two story shop in Amsterdam". Hidden in the Heisteeg, Hear Hear houses a beautiful collection of treasures (think cards, prints, books, bags, jewelry and more) from all over the world. Originally from Naaldwijk, Rena grew up in Rotterdam and made the move to Amsterdam for love (her boyfriend, Sam, co-owner of Pristine Fixed Gear). After making the move to the city, she fulfilled her dream of owning her own shop - Hear Hear recently celebrated its one year anniversary. Here&amp;squot;s what she had to say.  Can you tell us a little about yourself? I started studying graphic design at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam a few years ago. Even though it was a very inspirational time, I realized that I prefer to collect other peoples’ work as opposed to creating my own. It was during my time at the academy that I decided I wanted to start my own store, and that I wanted to collect and to sell beautiful products. With a background in graphic design, and an interest in interior design, I have been actively following blogs for a while now. I kept coming across products that I really liked, but couldn’t find in Amsterdam. That’s when I started the webshop, hearhearamsterdam.nl. What started as a webshop has now expanded into a ‘real’ shop in one of the greatest little places in Amsterdam. What brought you to Amsterdam? Love! I felt it was time for a change and my boyfriend Sam and I wanted to live together. I was living a pretty flexible life in Rotterdam and Sam was already living in Amsterdam, running a bicycle shop on the Kinkerstraat called Pristine Fixed Gear. It was more practical for me to move to Amsterdam (so romantic, I know!) and I’m still really happy about that decision. What inspired you to start Hear Hear? And what has your experience been so far? Hear Hear had been a webshop for about a year when I found the location on the Heisteeg in the center of Amsterdam. Sam and I would occasionally look at store spaces in the city, and when I found this one in the Heisteeg, I knew it would be perfect. It really fit with my dreams and ideas of Hear Hear: open brick walls, beams running along the ceiling, an all white interior… I jumped on the opportunity. And I’ve been open for one year now. It’s been a year in which Hear Hear has slowly transformed from an empty space into a unique store. Owning your own shop is hard work. I work 24/7 but I get so much in return. People are really enthusiastic which makes it all worth it.  Would you say that the city of Amsterdam inspires you?  Definitely! I think Amsterdam provides many more opportunities to realize and achieve your dreams than other cities. People come to Amsterdam to have a good time, or to start something. That’s very inspiring. And, it helps that Amsterdam is beautiful when the sun is shining, and even when it rains. What does a typical day look like for you? Sam and I wake up between 8.00 and 9.00. Sam gets up before me. I usually stay in bed and scroll through my Instagram feed, listen to the birds, and make a plan for the day. Once I finally get out of bed, I watch the news and make breakfast. By 10.30 I’m on my bike and attempt to avoid the thousands of tourists on my way to work. I usually have about 15 minutes before I open the shop, so I take my time, chat with the postman and the neighbors, and grab a coffee. At 11.00, the doors open. During the day I keep the store tidy, talk to people from all over the world who happen to wander by, keep an eye on my emails and browse websites in search of new products. By 18.00, I close up and meet Sam on my way home. We cook something for dinner and usually hang around the house. I’m a little bit of a homebody – I speak to so many people during the day that I don’t feel the need to go out anymore in the evenings. Can you name a few of your favorite places in Amsterdam? The goat farm in the Amsterdamse Bos is one of my favorite places. It’s this great little farm in the middle of the forest, and despite all the kids, it’s a really calm place. And goats are so cool! You can cuddle the animals, or grab a bite to eat in the cafe. You’ll also find fine products such as cheese and honey, and you can follow workshops. What&amp;squot;s next for you? I keep discovering beautiful products that I would like to sell in the shop. Everyday I search for treasures that I can add to the assortment I have here. The shop is less than a year old, but I regularly hear from enthusiastic customers that Hear Hear might just be the best shop in Amsterdam. And that’s a great compliment. It would be great if Hear Hear reaches the top 10 best shops in the city – highly recommended, a must-visit, a favorite. The potential is there, now just the fame! And perhaps then I can dare to dream about opening a second store some place else… Thank you Rena for this interview, and all the best to you! Hear Hear can be found on the Heisteeg 8 in the center of Amsterdam, and is open from Tuesday to Friday from 11.00 until 18.00, on Saturday from 11.00 until 17.00 and Sunday from 12.00 to 17.00.

         Pristine Fixed Gear

        <br/>
        <strong>
         Can you tell us a little about yourself?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        I started studying graphic design at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam a few years ago. Even though it was a very inspirational time, I realized that I prefer to collect other            peoples’ work as opposed to creating my own. It was during my time at the academy that I decided I wanted to start my own store, and that I wanted to collect and to sell beautiful            products.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With a background in graphic design, and an interest in interior design, I have been actively following blogs for a while now. I kept coming across products that I really liked, but            couldn’t find in Amsterdam. That’s when I started the webshop,
        <a href="http://www.hearhearamsterdam.nl/" target="_blank">
         hearhearamsterdam.nl
        </a>
        . What started as a webshop has now            expanded into a ‘real’ shop in one of the greatest little places in Amsterdam.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         What brought you to Amsterdam?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Love! I felt it was time for a change and my boyfriend Sam and I wanted to live together. I was living a pretty flexible life in Rotterdam and Sam was already living in Amsterdam, running            a bicycle shop on the Kinkerstraat called
        <a href="http://www.pristinefixedgear.com/" target="_blank">
         Pristine Fixed Gear
        </a>
        . It was more practical for me to move to            Amsterdam (so romantic, I know!) and I’m still really happy about that decision.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         What inspired you to start Hear Hear? And what has your experience been so far?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Hear Hear had been a webshop for about a year when I found the location on the Heisteeg in the center of Amsterdam. Sam and I would occasionally look at store spaces in the city, and            when I found this one in the Heisteeg, I knew it would be perfect. It really fit with my dreams and ideas of Hear Hear: open brick walls, beams running along the ceiling, an all            white interior… I jumped on the opportunity. And I’ve been open for one year now. It’s been a year in which Hear Hear has slowly transformed from an empty space into a unique store.            Owning your own shop is hard work. I work 24/7 but I get so much in return. People are really enthusiastic which makes it all worth it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         Would you say that the city of Amsterdam inspires you?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Definitely! I think Amsterdam provides many more opportunities to realize and achieve your dreams than other cities. People come to Amsterdam to have a good time, or to start something.            That’s very inspiring. And, it helps that Amsterdam is beautiful when the sun is shining, and even when it rains.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         What does a typical day look like for you?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Sam and I wake up between 8.00 and 9.00. Sam gets up before me. I usually stay in bed and scroll through my
        <a href="http://instagram.com/renahearhear" target="_blank">
         Instagram
        </a>
        feed,            listen to the birds, and make a plan for the day. Once I finally get out of bed, I watch the news and make breakfast. By 10.30 I’m on my bike and attempt to avoid the thousands of            tourists on my way to work. I usually have about 15 minutes before I open the shop, so I take my time, chat with the postman and the neighbors, and grab a coffee. At 11.00, the doors            open. During the day I keep the store tidy, talk to people from all over the world who happen to wander by, keep an eye on my emails and browse websites in search of new products. By            18.00, I close up and meet Sam on my way home. We cook something for dinner and usually hang around the house. I’m a little bit of a homebody – I speak to so many people during the day            that I don’t feel the need to go out anymore in the evenings.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         Can you name a few of your favorite places in Amsterdam?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The goat farm in the
        <a href="http://www.amsterdamsebos.nl/" target="_blank">
         Amsterdamse Bos
        </a>
        is one of my favorite places. It’s this great little farm in the middle of the forest, and            despite all the kids, it’s a really calm place. And goats are so cool! You can cuddle the animals, or grab a bite to eat in the cafe. You’ll also find fine products such as cheese and            honey, and you can follow workshops.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>
         What's next for you?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        I keep discovering beautiful products that I would like to sell in the shop. Everyday I search for treasures that I can add to the assortment I have here. The shop is less than a year            old, but I regularly hear from enthusiastic customers that Hear Hear might just be the best shop in Amsterdam. And that’s a great compliment. It would be great if Hear Hear reaches the            top 10 best shops in the city – highly recommended, a must-visit, a favorite. The potential is there, now just the fame! And perhaps then I can dare to dream about opening a second store            some place else…

          Hear Hear

         , a "tiny two story shop in Amsterdam". Hidden in the Heisteeg, Hear              Hear houses a beautiful collection of treasures (think cards, prints, books, bags, jewelry and more) from all over the world. Originally from Naaldwijk, Rena grew up in Rotterdam              and made the move to Amsterdam for love (her boyfriend, Sam, co-owner of
