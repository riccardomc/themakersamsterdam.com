  <meta property="og:description" content="Welcome to The Makers! To start this project, I would like to introduce Ruben Doornweerd (1988, Zwolle), a talented graphic designer based in Amsterdam. I was lucky enough to work with Ruben on a few projects in the past, and was thrilled that he wanted to create a logo for this project (thank you Ruben!) I visited Ruben's design studio in a shared studio space in the attic of a row house in De Pijp, just around the corner from the bustling street market, Albert Cuypmarkt.&nbsp; Can you tell us a little about yourself? After finishing secondary school, I wanted to either continue with music (I was a drummer) or start studying design, as I wanted to create artwork for band covers. I was accepted into the graphic design department at the Arnhem art school (ArtEZ), and soon found out that graphic design would encompass a lot more than just designing artwork for band covers. During my studies, I discovered that I really enjoyed creating and translating ideas into something visible and tangible. I studied for four years, worked overtime on school projects, and pushed myself to learn more and to continuously improve. What brought you to Amsterdam?&nbsp;What inspired you to start for yourself (your design studio)?&nbsp; Right after graduation, I applied for a starter grant (from the government). This grant supported young artists for a period of a year, and was designed to help artists undergo research projects and/or start for themselves - this grant, unfortunately, no longer exists. I was traveling around New Zealand when I heard that my grant proposal was approved. In Wellington, I did an internship at a small design studio called The International Office. It was there that I was motivated to set up my own studio (I also highly recommend the book,&nbsp;Studio Culture).&nbsp;When I returned to the Netherlands, I moved in with my sister while I was I was looking for an apartment, and a studio place. Within two weeks of searching for work, I was contacted by David and Marijke Hukema, the owners of the small shop, Restored. They were looking to rebrand their store. That was two and a half years ago. What have your experiences been so far? I've worked on many interesting projects in this time. I still enjoy my work every single day. I was also fortunate enough to work at a creative agency in the city. At Vandejong I helped design, among others printed materials for the first and second edition of Unseen. I have really learned a lot over the years.&nbsp;I have also come to realize that I need a particular work environment in order to be creative and productive. I need to work alone, in silence, but also need to be in the presence of other people to discuss my work. And I need to be able to play loud music. The attic studio that I share with five others (fashion designers and graphic designers) fits these needs perfectly. Would you say that the city of Amsterdam inspires you? I would.&nbsp;I really enjoy biking across town on my racing bike. My morning commute, from my apartment through the canals, to De Pijp, is always an inspirational start to my day. Everyone is biking to work and the city really comes to life.&nbsp;I also enjoy having short coffee breaks in the city.&nbsp;It helps me to take a break from my work,&nbsp;focus on something entirely different, and clears my mind. Every now and then I like to get away from the city and travel to the Norwegian or Scottish wilderness for a week or so. I really need this to recharge. What does a typical day look like for you?&nbsp; I get up in the morning. I cook oatmeal and brew a pot of black coffee while checking my email and reading the news. I then pack my computer in my backpack, walk down the four flights of stairs in my building, and grab my bike to cycle to work. When I get to my studio, I leave my stuff at my desk, grab a second cup of coffee and make a plan for the day. I usually make a trip to the supermarket to grab lunch as an excuse to get away from my screen. I prepare a couple of sandwiches back at the studio and eat together with the others. At around 14.30, I go out for a walk in the park or grab a coffee at a place nearby.&nbsp; Can you name a few of your favorite places in Amsterdam? For coffee, I recommend De Vredespijp (Eerste van der Helststraat 11), a cafe and furniture shop combined, and Two For Joy (Haarlemmerdijk 182) for the best cappuccino in town. For lunch, I like De Laatste Kruimel &nbsp;(Langebrugsteeg 4) or Buurtboederij&nbsp;(Spaarndammerdijk 319&nbsp;) when the sun's out. For dinner, FA. Spijkervet (Admiraal de Ruijterweg 79), Pazzi Pizza (Eerste Looiersdwarsstraat 4),&nbsp;Dwaze Zaken (Prins Hendrikkade 50), and for drinks Brecht (Weteringschans 157&nbsp;) for good German beers, Roest (Czaar Peterstraat 213&nbsp;) for it's outdoor fire pits, and Skek (Zeedijk 4), a nice hobbit loft). What's next for you?&nbsp; I hope to continue to work for myself. I've always seen it as an adventure - I continually take risks and make the most of the opportunities that come my way. Hopefully I will continue to work on new projects, and I hope to provide an internship opportunity for a graphic design student.&nbsp; Thanks Ruben for this interview (and for the great logo)!

        Welcome to The Makers! To start this project, I would like to introduce
        <a href="http://rubendoornweerd.nl/" target="_blank">
         Ruben Doornweerd
        </a>
        (1988, Zwolle), a talented graphic
            designer based in Amsterdam. I was lucky enough to work with Ruben on a few projects in the past, and was thrilled that he wanted to create a logo for this project (thank you Ruben!) I
            visited Ruben's design studio in a shared studio space in the attic of a row house in De Pijp, just around the corner from the bustling street market, Albert Cuypmarkt.&nbsp;
        <br />
        <span>
         <span>
          <b>
           <br />
           <strong>
            Can you tell us a little about yourself?
           </strong>
           <br />
          </b>
         </span>
        </span>
        After finishing secondary school, I wanted to either continue with music (I was a drummer) or start studying
            design, as I wanted to create artwork for band covers. I was accepted into the graphic design department at the Arnhem art school (ArtEZ), and soon found out that graphic design would
            encompass a lot more than just designing artwork for band covers. During my studies, I discovered that I really enjoyed creating and translating ideas into something visible and tangible.

         Welcome to The Makers! To start this project, I would like to introduce
         <a href="http://rubendoornweerd.nl/" target="_blank">
          Ruben Doornweerd
         </a>
         (1988, Zwolle), a talented graphic
              designer based in Amsterdam. I was lucky enough to work with Ruben on a few projects in the past, and was thrilled that he wanted to create a logo for this project (thank you Ruben!) I
              visited Ruben's design studio in a shared studio space in the attic of a row house in De Pijp, just around the corner from the bustling street market, Albert Cuypmarkt.&nbsp;

         After finishing secondary school, I wanted to either continue with music (I was a drummer) or start
              studying design, as I wanted to create artwork for band covers. I was accepted into the graphic design department at the Arnhem art school (ArtEZ), and soon found out that graphic
              design would encompass a lot more than just designing artwork for band covers. During my studies, I discovered that I really enjoyed creating and translating ideas into something
              visible and tangible. I studied for four years, worked overtime on school projects, and pushed myself to learn more and to continuously improve.

              starter grant (from the government). This grant supported young artists for a period of a year, and was designed to help artists undergo research projects and/or start for themselves -
              this grant, unfortunately, no longer exists. I was traveling around New Zealand when I heard that my grant proposal was approved. In Wellington, I did an internship at a small design
              studio called The International Office. It was there that I was motivated to set up my own studio (I also highly recommend the book,&nbsp;
